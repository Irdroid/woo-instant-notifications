Woo Instant Notifications is a plugin that helps you automatically print order receipts on a thermal printer for your WooCommerce Shop.

== Description ==

Print automatically receipts on a thermal printer for your  WooCommerce order.The Plugin allows you to customize the data on the printed receipts via shortcodes, triggers based on order status change, built in templates for order notification and packing slip. Works with thermal printers with paper size 58mm. How it works? The plugin sends formatted plain text emails based on order status change. On the receiving side a Mozilla thunderbird email autoprint addon is used with filters in order to print the receipts on the thermal printer. The plugin is very useful for online shops as the order notification receipts are automatically printed and the person responsible for order processing just sees the receipts and processes the order (Example - the person responsible for order processing goes to work in the morning and sees what is ordered and processes the orders without the need of even opening wordpress admin section. The receipts can also be used for marketing, coupon codes printing and sent with the ordered products etc.)
